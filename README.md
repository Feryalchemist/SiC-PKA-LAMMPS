# SiC-PKA-LAMMPS

This repository contains Lammps simulation to simulate radiation damage in SiC-3C. The simulation will perform a PKA simulation by giving velocity to the atom near the center with Miller direction index <1 3 5>. This atom could be C or Si, but in the same C centered lattice. The simulation is simply a reconstruction of [this works](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nme.2021.100957) but with Gao-Weber potential instead of Tersoff. The potentials are available on Lammps [github page](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/tree/develop/potentials).
